# TutorMe

TutorMe is a Mentorship application that faciliates matching Tutors with students based on their skill set, experiences, and 
various other factors. This is a [JSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages) project running on [IBM's WebSphere Liberty server](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/) and using [IBM Bluemix SQL database](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/). This project was created for IBM's Future Blue Hackathon. 

# Motivation

Thousands of students in Canada struggle to find a Tutor with the right kinds of academic teaching experience charging the ideal amount of money. TutorMe fills this need by allowing Tutors and students to sign up and create profiles of their skills/experiences and who they're looking for, respectively. Our application then employs an algorithm that recommends the best match of Tutors to students based on the information provided.
